3. **TermsOfServiceScreen.tsx** - In-app Terms display
4. **PrivacyPolicyScreen.tsx** - In-app Privacy Policy display

## üîó How to Add to Your App

### Step 1: Add to Navigation

Add these screens to your navigation stack in `RootNavigator.tsx`:

```typescript
import { TermsOfServiceScreen } from "../screens/TermsOfServiceScreen";
import { PrivacyPolicyScreen } from "../screens/PrivacyPolicyScreen";

// Inside your Stack.Navigator:
<Stack.Screen
  name="TermsOfService"
  component={TermsOfServiceScreen}
  options={{ title: "Terms of Service" }}
/>
<Stack.Screen
  name="PrivacyPolicy"
  component={PrivacyPolicyScreen}
  options={{ title: "Privacy Policy" }}
/>
```

### Step 2: Add Links in Settings Screen

In your `SettingsScreen.tsx`, add navigation options:

```typescript
<TouchableOpacity
  style={styles.settingItem}
  onPress={() => navigation.navigate("TermsOfService")}
>
  <Text style={styles.settingLabel}>Terms of Service</Text>
  <Ionicons name="chevron-forward" size={20} color={colors.textSecondary} />
</TouchableOpacity>

<TouchableOpacity
  style={styles.settingItem}
  onPress={() => navigation.navigate("PrivacyPolicy")}
>
  <Text style={styles.settingLabel}>Privacy Policy</Text>
  <Ionicons name="chevron-forward" size={20} color={colors.textSecondary} />
</TouchableOpacity>
```

### Step 3: Add to Onboarding/Signup

In your `OnboardingScreen.tsx` or signup flow, add acceptance checkboxes:

```typescript
<View style={styles.termsContainer}>
  <TouchableOpacity
    style={styles.checkbox}
    onPress={() => setAcceptTerms(!acceptTerms)}
  >
    <Ionicons
      name={acceptTerms ? "checkbox" : "square-outline"}
      size={24}
      color={colors.accentPurple}
    />
    <Text style={styles.termsText}>
      I agree to the{" "}
      <Text
        style={styles.link}
        onPress={() => navigation.navigate("TermsOfService")}
      >
        Terms of Service
      </Text>{" "}
      and{" "}
      <Text
        style={styles.link}
        onPress={() => navigation.navigate("PrivacyPolicy")}
      >
        Privacy Policy
      </Text>
    </Text>
  </TouchableOpacity>
</View>

<PrimaryButton
  title="Get Started"
  onPress={handleSignup}
  disabled={!acceptTerms}
/>
```

### Step 4: Add to Navigation Types

Update `app/src/navigation/types.ts`:

```typescript
export type RootStackParamList = {
  // ... existing screens
  TermsOfService: undefined;
  PrivacyPolicy: undefined;
};
